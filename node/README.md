Certification Node
==================

This is a Proxeus workflow node that allows connecting data from a form to the database for managing certificates.

As inputs, it takes the name of participants, team name, awards, and other project data, from the Proxeus API, and pushes this to the API of the app.

This node needs to be installed on the Proxeus server, and the location of the certification client app provided via an environment variable.
