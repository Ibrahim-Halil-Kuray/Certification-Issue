# Certification-Issue

Certification Issue is a Node.js and React.js project that demonstrates how to handle certification issues in a web application.

This project is useful for developers who want to learn how to handle certification issues in their 
own web applications and how to use HTTPS to secure their communication. It also serves as a reference 
implementation for developers who are building Node.js applications with HTTPS.

## Features

The Certification Issue project includes the following features:

- A sample Node.js server that uses the Express framework for routing and HTTPS for secure communication
- A form for entering certificate information, which is saved to a database
- The ability to check whether a certificate is registered or not via its ID
- The ability to view all registered certificates
- A new feature that displays registered certificates in a draft when needed
